# Known Bugs

It may make a mess out of pages with formatting that doesn't fit into how the script reads the files or if they do something fancy with their css.

There may be some hijinks going on with special characters and accents which may cause words to be bolded incorrectly.

If you get a permission error you can try emptying the output folder before running it again.
